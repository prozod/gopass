# 🛡️ Gopass – Simple Encrypted CLI Vault
> This README.md was generated by Gemini, but I verified it and it seems accurate and alright!

**Gopass** is a lightweight command-line tool written in Go for securely storing, encrypting, and retrieving secrets. It uses AES-GCM encryption with password-derived keys and stores passwords in your system keyring for convenience.

Perfect for developers or sysadmins who need fast, local, password-protected secret storage.

**DISCLAIMER:** I built this for fun, as a way to learn Go, and it is by no means a fully functional product - thus the code is quite trashy and bugs might appear. Use at own risk!

## ✨ Features

- 🔐 AES-256 GCM encryption
- 💾 Vault stored as a single encrypted file
- 🔑 Passwords stored securely in keyring (per vault)
- 📁 Export/import vaults easily as JSON
- 🧠 Remembers last used vault via `.gopassrc`
- ❌ Clears cached password when switching vaults

---

## 💡 Tips

- Vaults are standalone encrypted files — you can copy or move them freely as long as you remember the password.
- The password is stored in your keyring and retrieved automatically unless you remove it.
- Wrong password? It will detect decryption failure and re-prompt cleanly.

## 📁 Getting Started

### 🔧 First-time setup

```bash
go build . 
cp gopass ~/go/bin # or wherever you have your Go binaries!
```

```bash
gopass -config /path/to/vault.dat
```

> This will prompt for a password. If the file doesn't exist, it will be created.

---

## 🧪 Commands

```bash
gopass list
```
> List all stored keys

```bash
gopass add <key> <value>
```
> Add a new key–value pair to the vault

```bash
gopass get <key>
```
> Retrieve a stored value by key, the value is copied to clipboard automatically.

```bash
gopass export <filename> # filename example: 'workvault' (.json is appended automatically)
```
> Export vault contents to JSON file

```bash
gopass import <filename>
```
> Import entries from JSON file

```bash
gopass help
```
> Show usage information

---

## 🔄 Switching Vaults

To switch between vaults:

```bash
gopass -config /path/to/another.dat
```

> Automatically clears the previously cached password to avoid conflicts.

## 🧰 Requirements

- Go 1.22+
- Linux/macOS (keyring support)
- `libsecret` (Linux):  
  ```bash
  sudo apt install libsecret-1-0 libsecret-1-dev
  ```
